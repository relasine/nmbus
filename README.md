This project is a weather app designed specifically for phones. It uses simple, minimalist design built in React, leverages the Weather Underground api, and includes a custom auto-complete function as an npm module. This iteration of the project is a complete refactoring of a [previous weather app](http://www.github.com/relasine/weathrly) that I created for Mod 2 of the Front End Engineering program at The Turing School of Software and Design. 

All transitions are animated between the current forecast, ten-day forecast, seven-hour forecast, the search bar, and the logo.

A link to the npm module for the auto-complete function can be found [here](https://github.com/relasine/auto-complete)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
